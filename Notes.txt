Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resultant table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

// Returns all invoice data, employee data, customer data,
// BUT does not allow individual pieces to be selected efficiently
SELECT * FROM Invoice JOIN Customer ON Customer.CustomerId == Invoice.CustomerId JOIN Employee ON Customer.SupportRepId == Employee.EmployeeId

// Returns the customer's first and last name from the invoices
SELECT SalesInvoices.FirstName || ' ' || SalesInvoices.LastName FROM (SELECT * FROM Invoice JOIN Customer ON Customer.CustomerId == Invoice.CustomerId JOIN Employee ON Customer.SupportRepId == Employee.EmployeeId)AS SalesInvoices

// Returns the customer's first and last names, invoice total.
// and customer country -- cannot yet include sales rep names
SELECT SalesInvoices.FirstName || ' ' || SalesInvoices.LastName AS 'Customer Name', SalesInvoices.Total, SalesInvoices.Country FROM (SELECT * FROM Invoice JOIN Customer ON Customer.CustomerId == Invoice.CustomerId JOIN Employee ON Customer.SupportRepId == Employee.EmployeeId) AS SalesInvoices



// Capturing all the sales rep first and last names:
SELECT SalesReps.FirstName || ' ' || SalesReps.LastName FROM (SELECT * FROM Employee JOIN Customer ON Customer.SupportRepId == Employee.EmployeeId)AS SalesReps

// Capturing the sales rep's full name and his/her invoice ids:
SELECT SalesReps.FirstName || ' ' || SalesReps.LastName, Invoice.InvoiceId FROM (SELECT * FROM Employee JOIN Customer ON Customer.SupportRepId == Employee.EmployeeId) AS SalesReps JOIN Invoice ON Invoice.CustomerId == SalesReps.CustomerId


// Capturing the sales reps with names and complete invoices:
SELECT SalesReps.FirstName || ' ' || SalesReps.LastName, Invoice.* FROM (SELECT * FROM Employee JOIN Customer ON Customer.SupportRepId == Employee.EmployeeId) AS SalesReps JOIN Invoice ON Invoice.CustomerId == SalesReps.CustomerId


// Capturing sales rep names and complete invoices, ordered by sales rep name:
SELECT SalesReps.FirstName || ' ' || SalesReps.LastName, Invoice.* FROM (SELECT * FROM Employee JOIN Customer ON Customer.SupportRepId == Employee.EmployeeId) AS SalesReps JOIN Invoice ON Invoice.CustomerId == SalesReps.CustomerId ORDER BY SalesReps.FirstName || ' ' || SalesReps.LastName
